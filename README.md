# MoneyLaunderingDetector

## üåç **Project Overview**
**MoneyLaunderingDetector** is an advanced, scalable system for detecting unusual patterns in financial transactions to combat money laundering. Leveraging machine learning, data analytics, and domain expertise, this project addresses a critical challenge in the financial sector: identifying true suspicious activity while significantly reducing false positive alerts.

Current transaction monitoring systems face several challenges:

- **High False Positive Rates**: Leading to resource waste and analyst fatigue.
- **Lack of Contextual Intelligence**: Difficulty in distinguishing genuinely suspicious transactions from normal but unusual behavior.
- **Scalability Issues**: Existing systems often struggle to handle large volumes of data in real-time.
- **Evolving Threats**: Adapting to complex laundering schemes requires continuous innovation.

Our goal is to build a comprehensive AML solution that overcomes these challenges while providing actionable insights for compliance professionals and analysts.

## üéØ **Key Objectives**
1. **Reduce False Alerts**: Develop machine learning models and advanced rule-based systems to minimize false positives and focus on high-risk transactions.
2. **Enhance Detection Accuracy**: Use anomaly detection and behavior profiling to identify laundering patterns with precision.
3. **Outcome-Driven Approach**: Provide actionable outcomes like risk scores, investigation-ready alerts, and explainable models.
4. **Scalable and Modular Design**: Ensure the system is adaptable to different financial institution sizes and transaction volumes.
5. **Continuous Innovation**: Incorporate the latest techniques in graph analysis, network detection, and semi-supervised learning to adapt to evolving threats.

## üöÄ **Project Implementation Roadmap**

### **Phase 1: Data and Preprocessing**
- Collect synthetic datasets resembling real-world financial transactions (e.g., PaySim, Synthetic AML datasets).
- Develop robust preprocessing scripts to:
  - Handle missing values.
  - Normalize transaction amounts and time intervals.
  - Engineer domain-relevant features (e.g., transaction frequency, velocity, counterparties).

### **Phase 2: Anomaly Detection Models**
- **Supervised Learning**:
  - Train models like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting on labeled datasets.
- **Unsupervised Learning**:
  - Implement Isolation Forests, Autoencoders, and Clustering for anomaly detection.
- **Semi-Supervised Learning**:
  - Use One-Class SVMs or self-training approaches for imbalanced datasets.

### **Phase 3: Evaluation and Outcomes**
- Implement **custom metrics** tailored for AML, such as:
  - False Positive Rate (FPR) reduction.
  - True Positive Rate (TPR) maximization.
  - Alert-to-Suspicion Conversion Rate (ASCR).
- Develop detailed reporting dashboards with:
  - Flagged transactions and risk scores.
  - Visual explanations for flagged anomalies.
  - Metrics for tracking improvements over time.

### **Phase 4: Continuous Improvement**
- Introduce real-time processing capabilities.
- Extend detection capabilities to crypto transactions and non-bank financial entities.
- Refine models using adversarial machine learning techniques to simulate evolving threats.
